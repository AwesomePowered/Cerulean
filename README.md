Requires a VPS or Dedicated server running Linux, and intermediate knowledge of the linux operating system. If your using multicraft, this is not for you.

     Cerulean allows you to create a minecraft server within your server network by utilizing the amazing BungeeCord.
     ^ Think minecraft realms. Inspired by drtshocks' Empires. Created as proof of concept and tested by the players of PBA Network.
     Each player who created a server has full control of the server (OP).

     If you can't understand the code then I'm afraid this thing is not for you.
     Documentation is a bitch so figure it out yourself.
